  This line means, use default.hbs layout from src/html/layouts/
-->

{{!< default}}

<!-- 
  Put some content into an .hbs file inside of /partials, 
  and you can just throw it in anywhere!

    1. Rename the exported .html file to .hbs
    2. Put the .hbs file inside of 'html/story'
    3. Move the exported images to the images folder
    4. Include the partial normally like below
  -->
<script src="scripts/courtbars.js"></script>
<script src="scripts/courtbars1.js"></script>

  You can also put the actual HTML here if you really want to,
  although it's a little less organized looking
