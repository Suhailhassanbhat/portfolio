In 2019, five multifamily housing projects were under construction, one proposed and one completed. </p> <p>Affordable housing in Nassau and Suffolk counties has seen a boom in the past decade, especially picking up pace since 2014. Including the ongoing and proposed projects, a third of the affordable housing units since 1970 were added in the past decade. </p> <p style="text-align:left"><img src="housing.06adee75.png"> </p> <p>These cheaper housing options will likely attract low-income families to Long Island and backstop young adults who might be planning to leave the counties to find cheaper housing options in Queens and Brooklyn.</p> <p>Overall, the housing market in Long Island has been upbeat with a consistent growth in prices.</p> <p style="text-align:left"><img src="housing.09cf3faf.gif"> </p> <p>During the last five years, the number of projects in Nassau and Suffolk counties together hit a historical high at least since 1970, coming back from 25 years of rather muted growth. Especially, the apartment projects have seen a surge, outpacing condo and cooperative housing construction.</p> <p>During the seventies and eighties, most of the multifamily housing projects were located closer to Long Island Railroad stations in Nassau County as it falls closer to New York City. </p> <p>But this trend has changed as more housing projects have come up in the downtown area, away from the Long Island Railroad stations.</p> <p>A circle of one mile radius drawn around 124 stations of the railroad shows a host of new projects falling outside, meaning before renting or buying an apartment, one has to figure out the best and the cheapest mode of transportation to New York City.</p> <p> Moreover, the downside to this rise in multifamily housing is the greater need for a sewer system that can handle the pressure of an increased population. It remains to be seen whether Long Islandâ€™s sewer system can absorb that extra pressure, especially at a time when there have been growing concerns about the quality of drinking water.</p>  </div> <div> <p class="story-body"><a href="https://github.com/Suhailhassanbhat/Responsive-Designs-Repo/blob/master/LI-Housing"> Link to GitHub</a></p> </div> <style>.sticky{position:-webkit-sticky;position:sticky;top:0}#chart-1 .axis line{stroke:#999;stroke-width:.5;stroke-dasharray:3 2}p small{background:#fff880}.colored-text{padding:1px 7px;display:inline-block}</style> <script src="scrollytelling.4c8d8e13.js"></script>
