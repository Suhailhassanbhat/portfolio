Democrats appointed a higher number of judges to the U.S. district courts than Republicans since 1989 when George Bush was elected president.</p> <p>Data shows that the number of judges appointed to district courts by President Donald Trump is lesser than judges appointed by former President Barack Obama in equal time periods. In fact, Donald Trump put the second least number of judges on the Supreme Court during his time in office since 1989. </p>

Court of Appeals has powers in terms of making changes to the laws of the land and has the power to overturn judgments by district courts. </p> </div>
